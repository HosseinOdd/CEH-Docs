## What is Social Engineering?

Social engineering is the psychological manipulation of people to perform actions or divulge confidential information. It exploits human psychology rather than technical vulnerabilities.

## Types of Social Engineering

### Human-Based Social Engineering

**Impersonation**
Pretending to be someone else to gain trust and access to information.

**Eavesdropping**
Listening to private conversations to gather sensitive information.

**Shoulder Surfing**
Observing someone's screen or keyboard to obtain information.

**Dumpster Diving**
Searching through trash to find confidential documents or information.

**Tailgating**
Following authorized personnel into restricted areas.

### Computer-Based Social Engineering

**Phishing**
Sending fraudulent emails that appear to be from reputable sources to steal sensitive data.

**Spear Phishing**
Targeted phishing attacks aimed at specific individuals or organizations.

**Vishing (Voice Phishing)**
Using phone calls to trick victims into revealing information.

**Smishing (SMS Phishing)**
Using text messages to deceive victims.

**Baiting**
Offering something enticing to lure victims into a trap.

**Pretexting**
Creating a fabricated scenario to obtain information.

## Common Social Engineering Techniques

### Authority
Pretending to be in a position of power to command compliance.

### Urgency
Creating a sense of time pressure to bypass rational thinking.

### Intimidation
Using threats or aggressive behavior to force compliance.

### Trust
Building rapport and exploiting the victim's trust.

### Scarcity
Creating a sense that an opportunity is limited or rare.

## Social Engineering Attack Cycle

1. **Research**: Gathering information about the target
2. **Hook**: Establishing contact and building trust
3. **Play**: Executing the attack scenario
4. **Exit**: Leaving without raising suspicion

## Warning Signs

- Unusual requests for sensitive information
- Pressure to act quickly
- Requests to bypass security procedures
- Too good to be true offers
- Unverified or suspicious contacts

## Prevention and Defense

### For Organizations

- Clear security policies
- Verification procedures
- Incident reporting system
- Regular security drills

### For Individuals
- Verify identities before sharing information
- Be skeptical of unsolicited requests
- Never share passwords or sensitive data
