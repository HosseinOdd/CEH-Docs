## Google Dorking

Google Dorking (Google Hacking) is the practice of using advanced search operators to find sensitive information that is publicly available but difficult to find through normal searches.

## Google Search Operators

### Basic Operators

**site:** - Search within a specific domain
```
site:example.com
```

**filetype:** - Search for specific file types
```
filetype:pdf confidential
site:example.com filetype:xlsx
```

**intitle:** - Search for terms in page title
```
intitle:"index of" password
intitle:login admin
```

**inurl:** - Search for terms in URL
```
inurl:admin
inurl:login site:example.com
```

**intext:** - Search for terms in page content
```
intext:"password" filetype:log
```

**cache:** - View Google's cached version
```
cache:example.com
```

**link:** - Find pages linking to a URL
```
link:example.com
```

**related:** - Find similar websites

site:example.com filetype:xls "password"
site:example.com filetype:doc "internal use only"
```

### Finding Login Pages
```
intitle:"Login" inurl:admin
intitle:"Admin Panel" inurl:login
inurl:wp-admin site:example.com
```

### Finding Directory Listings

```

### Finding Database Information
```
filetype:sql "password" site:example.com
inurl:phpmyadmin site:example.com
"Index of" mysql.conf
```

### Finding Network Information
```
intitle:"Network Configuration"
filetype:cfg cisco
inurl:config.php site:example.com
```

## Google Hacking Database (GHDB)

A database of Google dorks maintained by the security community. Categories include:
- Sensitive Directories
- Files Containing Passwords
- Vulnerable Files
- Vulnerable Servers
- Error Messages
- Files Containing Juicy Info

## Best Practices

- Always have authorization before testing
- Respect privacy and legal boundaries
- Document findings properly
- Report vulnerabilities responsibly

## Prevention

### For Website Owners
- Use robots.txt to block sensitive areas
- Implement proper access controls
- Remove sensitive information from public areas
- Regular security audits
- Monitor for exposed information
