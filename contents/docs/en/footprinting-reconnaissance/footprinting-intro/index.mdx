## What is Footprinting?

Footprinting is the first and most crucial phase of ethical hacking, where information is systematically collected about a target system, network, or organization. This reconnaissance phase helps identify potential vulnerabilities and attack vectors.

## Objectives of Footprinting

- **Know Security Posture**: Understanding the target's security infrastructure
- **Reduce Focus Area**: Narrowing down specific targets and entry points
- **Identify Vulnerabilities**: Discovering weaknesses in systems and networks
- **Draw Network Map**: Creating a comprehensive view of the target infrastructure

## Types of Footprinting

### Passive Footprinting
Collecting information without directly engaging with the target. Leaves no digital traces.

**Characteristics:**
- No direct interaction with target
- Difficult to detect
- Uses publicly available information
- Lower risk of detection

### Active Footprinting
Direct interaction with the target system to gather information. May leave traces in logs.

**Characteristics:**
- Direct system engagement
- Can be detected through logs
- More detailed information
- Higher risk of detection

## Footprinting Methodology

1. **Define Scope**: Determine what information is needed
2. **Information Gathering**: Collect data from various sources
3. **Analysis**: Process and organize collected information
4. **Documentation**: Record findings systematically
5. **Reporting**: Present actionable intelligence

## Information Collected Through Footprinting

- **Organization Information**: Company structure, employee details
- **Network Information**: IP addresses, domains, network ranges
- **System Information**: Operating systems, applications, services
- **Security Information**: Firewall configs, IDS/IPS details
