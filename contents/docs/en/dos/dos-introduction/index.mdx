## Overview

A Denial of Service (DoS) attack is an attempt to make a computer, network, or service unavailable to its intended users. Unlike attacks that steal or modify data, DoS attacks focus on disrupting the availability of systems.

DoS attacks can be executed using a single system or multiple systems (Distributed DoS or DDoS), and are commonly aimed at websites, servers, or networks.

## Objectives of DoS Attacks

- Disrupt business operations
- Render critical services unavailable
- Overwhelm network bandwidth or system resources
- Cause financial or reputational damage

## Common Targets

| Target | Description |
|--------|------------|
| Web Servers | Websites or online applications |
| Network Infrastructure | Routers, firewalls, or ISPs |
| Applications | Critical business applications |
| Individual Systems | Personal computers or devices |

## Why DoS Attacks Are Important in CEH

Understanding DoS attacks is crucial for ethical hackers to identify vulnerabilities, simulate attack scenarios, and design preventive measures. CEH emphasizes both the technical and operational impact of DoS attacks.
