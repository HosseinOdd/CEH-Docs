title: DoS Attack Layers
description: Detailed explanation of layers targeted by Denial of Service attacks
---

## Introduction

Denial of Service (DoS) attacks can target different layers of a system, from low-level network infrastructure to high-level applications. Each layer has its own weaknesses, attack techniques, and mitigation methods.

Understanding these layers is essential in CEH to correctly analyze attacks and design effective defenses.

## Network Layer Attacks

Network layer DoS attacks focus on overwhelming network bandwidth or network devices. These attacks generate a massive amount of traffic, making it impossible for legitimate users to reach the target system.

Common characteristics:
- High volume of packets
- Bandwidth exhaustion
- Targeting routers, firewalls, or network links

Examples include ICMP flood and UDP flood attacks.

## Transport Layer Attacks

Transport layer attacks exploit weaknesses in transport protocols such as TCP. These attacks attempt to exhaust connection tables or system resources by creating incomplete or excessive connections.

Key points:
- Exploits protocol behavior
- Consumes server connection resources
- Difficult to detect without traffic analysis

A common example is the TCP SYN flood attack.

## Application Layer Attacks

Application layer DoS attacks target specific services or applications rather than the network itself. These attacks mimic legitimate user behavior, making them harder to detect.

Characteristics:
- Low traffic volume
- High processing cost on the server
- Targets web servers, DNS, or APIs

Examples include HTTP flood and Slowloris attacks.

## Physical Layer Attacks

Although less common, physical layer DoS attacks involve disrupting hardware or physical infrastructure. These attacks require physical access but can cause complete service outages.

Examples include power disruption, cable damage, or hardware tampering.

## Summary of DoS Layers

| Layer | Target | Impact |
|------|------|-------|
| Network | Bandwidth and devices | Service unreachable |
| Transport | Connections and sessions | Resource exhaustion |
| Application | Services and applications | Service crash or slowdown |
| Physical | Hardware and facilities | Total service outage |

## CEH Perspective

CEH emphasizes identifying the targeted layer of a DoS attack to apply appropriate detection and mitigation techniques. Each layer requires different monitoring and defense strategies.
