description: Introduction to hping3 and its relation to DoS attacks in CEH

## Introduction

hping3 is a command-line network security tool used for crafting and sending custom TCP/IP packets. It allows security professionals and ethical hackers to analyze network behavior, test firewall rules, and evaluate intrusion detection systems.

In CEH, hping3 is studied as an educational tool to understand low-level network protocols and how they can be abused.

## Core Features of hping3

hping3 provides fine-grained control over network packets, including:
- Sending TCP, UDP, and ICMP packets
- Manual control of TCP flags such as SYN, ACK, and FIN
- Custom source and destination ports
- Analyzing target system responses
- Generating traffic to test service availability

This level of control makes hping3 a powerful network analysis tool.

## Common Uses of hping3 in CEH

| Use Case | Description |
|--------|------------|
| Firewall Testing | Evaluating packet filtering rules |
| IDS/IPS Testing | Observing detection and response behavior |
| Network Analysis | Studying responses to crafted packets |
| Availability Testing | Measuring service tolerance to traffic |

## Relation of hping3 to DoS

hping3 has a direct relationship with Denial of Service (DoS) attacks because it can generate large volumes of network traffic toward a target system. By sending crafted packets repeatedly, system resources such as bandwidth, connection tables, or CPU can be exhausted.

In CEH, hping3 is used in controlled lab environments to simulate DoS attacks in order to:
- Identify when a target system becomes unavailable
- Analyze firewall and IDS/IPS responses
- Determine which network layer is being affected
- Understand resource exhaustion behavior

These simulations help security professionals design better defensive strategies.

## Example Educational Commands

```bash
# Send ICMP packets to test responsiveness
hping3 -1 target_ip

# Send TCP packets with SYN flag
hping3 -S -p 80 target_ip

# Send UDP packets
hping3 -2 -p 53 target_ip
