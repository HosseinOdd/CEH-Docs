## Introduction

Preventing Denial of Service (DoS) attacks is a critical aspect of cybersecurity. DoS attacks aim to make a system or service unavailable to legitimate users, potentially causing financial, operational, and reputational damage. Prevention involves a combination of network-level, application-level, and organizational strategies.

## Key Prevention Techniques

| Technique | Description |
|-----------|------------|
| Firewalls & Rate Limiting | Block excessive traffic or suspicious sources |
| Intrusion Detection/Prevention Systems | Detect and respond to abnormal traffic patterns |
| Traffic Filtering & Blackholing | Filter unwanted traffic before it reaches the target |
| Redundancy & Load Balancing | Distribute traffic across multiple servers to avoid overload |
| Network Monitoring | Continuous analysis to detect early signs of DoS |
| Secure Application Design | Optimize web services to handle high traffic efficiently |
| User & Staff Training | Awareness of DoS symptoms and reporting unusual network behavior |

## Example: Rate Limiting

```text
# Limit the number of connections per IP to 100 per minute
iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 80 -m connlimit --connlimit-above 100 -j DROP
