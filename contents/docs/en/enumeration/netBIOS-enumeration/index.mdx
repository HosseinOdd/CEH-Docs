title: NetBIOS Enumeration
description: Detailed enumeration of NetBIOS services to identify Windows network resources and information leakage

## Overview

NetBIOS Enumeration is the process of extracting information from systems that use the NetBIOS protocol, commonly found in Windows-based networks. NetBIOS allows applications on different computers to communicate over a local network, but improper configuration can lead to significant information disclosure.

This type of enumeration is especially useful in internal network assessments where legacy services or older Windows systems are present.

## What is NetBIOS

NetBIOS (Network Basic Input/Output System) is a networking protocol that provides name resolution, session management, and data transport services. It typically operates over TCP/IP using ports 137, 138, and 139.

Although NetBIOS is largely replaced by modern protocols, it is still enabled in many networks for compatibility reasons.

## Information Gathered via NetBIOS Enumeration

During NetBIOS enumeration, an attacker or penetration tester may obtain:
- Computer and host names
- Logged-in user information
- Workgroup or domain names
- Shared resources and network shares
- MAC addresses and network interfaces

This information can be collected without authentication in poorly secured environments.

## Security Impact

Successful NetBIOS enumeration can:
- Reveal internal network structure
- Assist in identifying valid systems and users
- Enable targeted attacks against shared resources
- Support lateral movement within the network

From a defensive perspective, NetBIOS is considered a high-risk legacy service if not properly restricted.

## Role in Ethical Hacking and CEH

In the CEH methodology, NetBIOS enumeration is introduced as a classic example of information leakage caused by legacy protocols. Ethical hackers must understand how NetBIOS works in order to identify insecure configurations and recommend secure alternatives.
