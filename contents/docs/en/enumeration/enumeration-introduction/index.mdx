## Overview

Enumeration is a critical and active phase in the ethical hacking process that takes place after scanning. During this phase, an attacker or penetration tester establishes direct interaction with the target system to extract detailed and structured information.

Unlike reconnaissance and scanning, which focus on identifying systems and services, enumeration aims to gather specific data such as usernames, groups, shared resources, and service configurations.

This phase provides actionable intelligence that can be leveraged in exploitation and privilege escalation stages.

## Enumeration vs Scanning

While scanning identifies open ports, services, and potential vulnerabilities, enumeration goes deeper by querying services to retrieve meaningful data.

Enumeration answers questions such as:
- Who are the valid users on the system?
- What resources are shared?
- What services expose sensitive information?
- How is the system structured internally?

## Common Enumeration Targets

Enumeration can be performed against multiple components, including:
- Operating systems (Windows and Linux)
- Network services
- Directory services (LDAP, Active Directory)
- Protocols such as DNS, SNMP, SMTP, and NetBIOS

Each target can reveal valuable information if misconfigured or poorly secured.

## Security Impact

Successful enumeration significantly increases the attack surface. It enables attackers to:
- Launch targeted password attacks
- Perform privilege escalation
- Move laterally within the network
- Bypass certain security controls

For defenders, understanding enumeration is essential to identify information leakage and strengthen system hardening.

## Role in CEH

In the CEH framework, enumeration is considered a foundational skill. Ethical hackers must understand enumeration techniques in order to simulate real-world attacks and assess the effectiveness of defensive controls.
