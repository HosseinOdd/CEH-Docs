title: DNS Enumeration
description: In-depth enumeration of DNS records to identify hosts, services, and network structure

## Overview

DNS Enumeration is the process of gathering detailed information from the Domain Name System (DNS). DNS plays a critical role in mapping domain names to IP addresses, and misconfigured DNS servers can leak valuable information about an organization’s internal and external infrastructure.

This type of enumeration is commonly performed during the early stages of an attack to build an accurate map of the target network.

## What is DNS

DNS (Domain Name System) is a hierarchical and distributed naming system used to translate human-readable domain names into IP addresses. It also provides additional records that describe mail servers, name servers, and other services.

Because DNS is often publicly accessible, it is a prime target for information gathering.

## Information Gathered via DNS Enumeration

Through DNS enumeration, an attacker or penetration tester may discover:
- Domain and subdomain names
- IP addresses of servers and hosts
- Name servers (NS records)
- Mail servers (MX records)
- Service information (TXT, SRV records)
- Network ranges and internal hostnames

In some cases, misconfigured DNS servers allow zone transfers, exposing complete DNS records.

## Security Impact

Successful DNS enumeration can:
- Reveal internal network structure
- Identify critical servers and services
- Assist in targeted phishing or email attacks
- Support further scanning and exploitation phases

From a defensive standpoint, DNS misconfigurations are a common source of information leakage.

## Role in Ethical Hacking and CEH

In CEH, DNS enumeration is introduced as a fundamental reconnaissance and enumeration technique. Ethical hackers must understand DNS behavior to identify exposed records, misconfigurations, and weaknesses in domain infrastructure.
