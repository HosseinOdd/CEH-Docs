## What is Malware?

Malware (Malicious Software) is any software intentionally designed to cause damage to a computer, server, client, or computer network. It encompasses various types of hostile software including viruses, worms, trojans, ransomware, spyware, and more.

## Types of Malware

### 1. Virus
- Attaches to legitimate files
- Requires host program to run
- Spreads through user actions
- Can corrupt or delete data

### 2. Worm
- Self-replicating
- Spreads without user interaction
- Exploits network vulnerabilities
- Consumes bandwidth and resources

### 3. Trojan
- Disguised as legitimate software
- No self-replication
- Provides backdoor access
- Steals sensitive information

### 4. Ransomware
- Encrypts victim's files
- Demands payment for decryption
- Growing threat globally
- Examples: WannaCry, Cryptolocker

### 5. Spyware
- Monitors user activity
- Steals personal information
- Keyloggers, screen capture
- Often bundled with legitimate software

### 6. Adware
- Displays unwanted advertisements
- Tracks browsing behavior
- Slows system performance
- Privacy concerns

### 7. Rootkit
- Hides malware presence
- Provides privileged access
- Difficult to detect
- Modifies OS components

### 8. Backdoor
- Bypasses normal authentication
- Provides remote access
- Persistent access method
- Often installed by trojans

### 9. Bot/Botnet
- Automated malicious software
- Part of larger network (botnet)
- Used for DDoS attacks
- Controlled by command & control server

### 10. Fileless Malware
- Resides in memory only
- No files written to disk
- Uses legitimate tools (PowerShell, WMI)
- Difficult to detect

## Malware Characteristics

### Propagation Methods
- **Email attachments**: Malicious files
- **Downloads**: Infected software
- **Removable media**: USB drives
- **Network shares**: Shared folders
- **Drive-by downloads**: Compromised websites
- **Social engineering**: Tricking users

### Common Behaviors
- File modification/deletion
- Data exfiltration
- System slowdown
- Unauthorized network connections
- Popup windows
- Browser hijacking
- Disabled security software

## Attack Vectors

### 1. Phishing
- Fraudulent emails
- Fake websites
- Social engineering
- Credential harvesting

### 2. Exploit Kits
- Automated attack tools
- Target software vulnerabilities
- Drive-by downloads
- Examples: Angler, RIG

### 3. Watering Hole
- Compromise frequently visited sites
- Target specific groups
- Strategic placement

### 4. Supply Chain Attack
- Compromise software vendors
- Distribute through updates
- Trusted distribution channels

### 5. Malvertising
- Malicious advertisements
- On legitimate websites
- No user interaction needed

## Malware Objectives

### Information Theft
- Credentials and passwords
- Financial information
- Personal data
- Intellectual property
- Trade secrets

### System Control

## Signs of Infection

### Performance Issues
- Slow startup/shutdown
- Programs crash frequently
- High CPU/memory usage
- Excessive disk activity

### Network Activity
- Unusual outbound traffic
- Unknown connections
- Bandwidth consumption
- Blocked websites

### System Changes
- New toolbars/extensions
- Changed homepage
- Disabled antivirus
- Missing files
- New unknown programs

### Visual Indicators
- Popup messages
- Ransom notes
- Warning messages
- Unexpected restarts

## Prevention Methods

### Technical Controls
- **Antivirus/Antimalware**: Up-to-date signatures
- **Firewall**: Block malicious traffic
- **Patch Management**: Keep systems updated
- **Email Filtering**: Block malicious emails
- **Web Filtering**: Block dangerous sites
- **Application Whitelisting**: Allow only approved apps
- **Sandboxing**: Isolate suspicious files

### User Education
- Avoid suspicious emails
- Don't click unknown links
- Verify downloads
- Use strong passwords
- Enable 2FA
- Regular backups

### Network Security
- Segment networks
- Monitor traffic
- IDS/IPS systems
- Access control
- Least privilege principle

## Malware Analysis Types

### Static Analysis
- Examine without execution
- File properties
- Strings extraction
- Disassembly
- Less risky

### Dynamic Analysis
- Execute in controlled environment
- Observe behavior
- Monitor system changes
- Network activity
- More comprehensive

### Hybrid Analysis
- Combination of both
- Comprehensive understanding
- Better detection

## Common Malware Families

### Banking Trojans
- **Zeus**: Credential theft
- **Dridex**: Banking fraud
- **Emotet**: Modular trojan

### Ransomware
