## What are Computer Viruses?

A computer virus is malicious code that attaches itself to legitimate programs or files and replicates when executed. It requires a host program to spread and typically causes harm to the infected system.

## Characteristics

- **Self-replication**: Copies itself
- **Host required**: Needs program to attach
- **User action needed**: Requires execution
- **Payload**: Malicious functionality
- **Infection mechanism**: Spreads to other files

## Virus Life Cycle

### 1. Creation
- Written by malware author
- Contains replication code
- Includes payload

### 2. Replication
- Attach to host files
- Spread to other files/systems
- Modify system files

### 3. Activation
- Triggered by condition
- Date/time (logic bomb)
- User action
- System event

### 4. Execution
- Deliver payload
- Cause damage
- Spread further

## Types of Viruses

### File Infector Virus
- Attaches to executable files (.exe, .com)
- Activates when program runs
- Examples: Jerusalem, Cascade

### Boot Sector Virus
- Infects boot sector of drives
- Loads before OS
- Hard to remove
- Examples: Michelangelo, Stoned

### Macro Virus
- Infects documents (Word, Excel)
- Written in macro language
- Spreads via documents
- Examples: Melissa, I Love You

### Polymorphic Virus
- Changes code each infection
- Evades signature detection
- Mutates continuously
- Examples: Storm Worm

### Metamorphic Virus
- Completely rewrites code
- More advanced than polymorphic
- Very hard to detect

### Multipartite Virus
- Infects multiple locations
- Boot sector + files
- Harder to remove

### Cavity Virus
- Fills empty spaces in files
- Doesn't increase file size
- Harder to detect

### Direct Action Virus
- Activates immediately
- Doesn't stay in memory
- Infects files in directory

### Resident Virus
- Stays in memory
- Infects files as accessed
- Persistent

## Famous Viruses

### ILOVEYOU (2000)
- Spread via email
- VBS script
- $10 billion damage
- 10% of PCs infected

### Melissa (1999)
- Macro virus
- Email mass-mailer
- First major email virus

### Code Red (2001)
- Worm variant
- Exploited IIS
- DDoS attack capability

### Slammer/Sapphire (2003)
- Fastest spreading worm
- 75,000 hosts in 10 minutes
- UDP-based

## Detection Methods

### Signature-Based
```bash
# Antivirus scanning
clamscan -r /path/to/scan
freshclam  # Update signatures
```

### Heuristic Analysis
- Behavior patterns
- Suspicious activities
- Proactive detection

### Integrity Checking
```bash
# Create file database
sudo aide --init

# Check for changes
sudo aide --check
```

### Sandbox Analysis
- Execute in isolated environment
- Observe behavior
- Prevent harm

## Prevention

### Best Practices
1. Install antivirus
2. Keep software updated
3. Avoid suspicious files
4. Use email filtering
5. Regular backups
6. Disable macros
7. User education

### Technical Controls
```bash
# File permissions
chmod 644 file.txt  # Read-only

# Immutable files
sudo chattr +i important_file

# SELinux/AppArmor
sestatus
aa-status
```

## Removal

### Manual Steps
1. Boot into Safe Mode
2. Delete temporary files
3. Run antivirus scan
4. Check startup programs
5. Restore from backup

### Automated Tools
```bash
# ClamAV
sudo apt install clamav
sudo clamscan --remove -r /

# Scan boot sector
sudo clamscan --scan-boot-sectors /dev/sda
```

## Creating Virus (Educational Only)

⚠️ **Illegal to distribute!**

### Simple Batch Virus (Windows)
```batch
@echo off
:start
copy %0 random_file.bat
goto start
```

### VBScript Example
```vb
Set objFSO = CreateObject("Scripting.FileSystemObject")
objFSO.CopyFile WScript.ScriptFullName, "virus.vbs"
```

## Legal Considerations

- Creating viruses: Often illegal
- Distribution: Serious crime
- Testing: Only in isolated labs
- Authorization required
- Ethical hacking rules apply
