## Overview

Social Engineering is the art of manipulating people into revealing confidential information or performing actions that compromise security. Unlike technical attacks, social engineering exploits human psychology rather than software vulnerabilities.

Because humans are often the weakest link in security, social engineering remains one of the most effective attack vectors in cybersecurity.

## What is Social Engineering

Social engineering involves influencing, persuading, or deceiving individuals to gain unauthorized access to systems, data, or physical locations. Attackers often impersonate trusted entities or create believable scenarios to lower a victim’s defenses.

These attacks can occur through digital, verbal, or physical interactions.

## Why Social Engineering is Effective

Social engineering attacks succeed due to:
- Lack of security awareness
- Trust in authority or familiar identities
- Fear, urgency, or curiosity
- Desire to be helpful or cooperative

Attackers carefully design scenarios that trigger emotional responses rather than logical thinking.

## Common Targets

Social engineering targets may include:
- Employees and staff members
- System administrators
- Executives and managers
- Help desk personnel
- Customers and end users

Even well-secured systems can be compromised if users are manipulated successfully.

## Role in Ethical Hacking and CEH

In the CEH framework, social engineering is a core topic. Ethical hackers study social engineering techniques to assess human-related risks, test organizational awareness, and recommend effective security training and policies.
