## Overview

A Social Engineering Attack is an attack in which the attacker manipulates individuals into revealing confidential information or performing actions that compromise security. Unlike technical attacks, social engineering relies on psychological manipulation rather than software vulnerabilities.

These attacks are widely used as an initial access technique in real-world cyber attacks.

## Key Characteristics of Social Engineering Attacks

Social engineering attacks share several common characteristics:
- They appear legitimate and trustworthy
- They exploit human emotions and behavior
- They often bypass technical security controls
- They rely on urgency, fear, or authority

Because humans are involved, detection is often difficult.

## Common Social Engineering Attack Techniques

| Technique | Description | Example |
|--------|------------|--------|
| Phishing | Fraudulent emails or messages | Fake password reset email |
| Vishing | Voice-based attacks | Call from “IT support” |
| Smishing | SMS-based phishing | Malicious bank SMS |
| Impersonation | Pretending to be a trusted entity | Fake manager request |
| Pretexting | Creating a fake scenario | Urgent audit request |
| Tailgating | Physical access attack | Following an employee inside |

## Attack Execution Flow

A typical social engineering attack follows this flow:
1. Identify the target
2. Collect background information
3. Build trust and credibility
4. Deliver the attack payload
5. Achieve the attacker’s objective

Each step increases the chance of success.
