## Overview

Social engineering attacks follow a structured process designed to manipulate human behavior and extract sensitive information. Understanding these phases helps security professionals detect attacks early and implement effective countermeasures.

In CEH, social engineering is analyzed as a multi-phase attack rather than a single action.

## Social Engineering Attack Phases

| Phase | Name | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| 1 | Reconnaissance | Gathering information about the target |
| 2 | Relationship Building | Establishing trust and credibility |
| 3 | Exploitation | Manipulating the victim to achieve the goal |
| 4 | Execution | Performing the attack action |
| 5 | Exit | Ending the interaction and covering tracks |

## Phase 1: Reconnaissance

Reconnaissance involves collecting information about the target such as job role, contact details, habits, and organizational structure. Attackers use public sources like social media, company websites, and leaked databases.

The more accurate the information, the more convincing the attack will be.

## Phase 2: Relationship Building

In this phase, the attacker establishes trust by impersonating a trusted individual or authority figure. This can be done through friendly conversation, professional tone, or exploiting shared interests.

Trust is the most critical element in social engineering attacks.

## Phase 3: Exploitation

Once trust is established, the attacker manipulates the victim using psychological triggers such as urgency, fear, curiosity, or authority. The goal is to bypass rational thinking.

This phase directly targets human weaknesses.

## Phase 4: Execution

The execution phase is where the victim performs the desired action, such as:
- Revealing credentials
- Clicking a malicious link
- Downloading a file
- Granting physical or logical access

At this stage, the attack succeeds.

## Phase 5: Exit

The attacker ends the interaction while minimizing suspicion. This may include deleting communication traces or providing excuses to avoid follow-up questions.

A clean exit reduces the chance of detection.

## CEH Perspective

CEH emphasizes understanding each phase to design detection points and preventive controls at every stage of the attack lifecycle.
