## What is Network Scanning?

Network scanning is the second phase of ethical hacking that involves actively probing a target network to identify live hosts, open ports, services, and vulnerabilities. This phase provides crucial information for penetration testing.

## Objectives of Network Scanning

- **Discover Live Hosts**: Identify active devices on the network
- **Identify Open Ports**: Find accessible network ports on target systems
- **Detect Services**: Determine services running on open ports
- **OS Detection**: Identify operating systems of target hosts
- **Find Vulnerabilities**: Discover potential security weaknesses

## Types of Network Scanning

### Port Scanning
Checking which ports are open, closed, or filtered on target systems.

**Port States:**
- **Open**: Port is accepting connections
- **Closed**: Port is accessible but no service listening
- **Filtered**: Port blocked by firewall or filtering device

### Network Scanning
Identifying live hosts and their network addresses.

**Techniques:**
- ICMP Echo Requests (Ping)
- ARP Scanning
- TCP/UDP Scanning

### Vulnerability Scanning
Automated scanning to identify known vulnerabilities.

## TCP Three-Way Handshake

Understanding TCP handshake is crucial for port scanning:

1. **SYN**: Client sends SYN packet to server
2. **SYN-ACK**: Server responds with SYN-ACK
3. **ACK**: Client sends ACK to complete connection

## Common Port Scanning Techniques

### TCP Connect Scan
Completes full TCP three-way handshake. Most reliable but easily detected.

### SYN Scan (Half-Open)
Sends SYN packet and analyzes response without completing handshake. Stealthier than connect scan.

### FIN Scan
Sends FIN packet to check if port is open. Works against systems that follow RFC 793.

### NULL Scan
Sends packet with no flags set. Used to bypass simple firewalls.

### XMAS Scan
Sends packet with FIN, PSH, and URG flags. Called "XMAS" because flags light up like Christmas tree.

### ACK Scan
Used to map firewall rules and determine if ports are filtered.

### UDP Scan
Scans UDP ports which are connectionless. Slower and less reliable than TCP scans.

### Idle Scan
Uses a zombie host to scan target, making scan appear from different source.

## Scanning Methodology

### 1. Check for Live Systems
Identify which hosts are active on the network.

### 2. Check for Open Ports
Determine which ports are accessible on live hosts.

### 3. Banner Grabbing
Capture service banners to identify software versions.

### 4. Scan for Vulnerabilities
Use vulnerability scanners to find security weaknesses.

### 5. Draw Network Diagrams
Map the network topology and relationships.

### 6. Prepare Proxies
Use proxies to hide scanning origin and avoid detection.

## Common Network Scanning Tools

- **Nmap**: Most popular port scanner
- **Hping3**: Packet crafting and analysis tool
- **Masscan**: Fast port scanner for large networks
- **Nessus**: Vulnerability scanner
- **OpenVAS**: Open-source vulnerability scanner
- **Angry IP Scanner**: Fast IP and port scanner

## Scanning Considerations

### Legal and Ethical
- Always obtain proper authorization
- Stay within scope of engagement
- Follow responsible disclosure practices

### Technical
- Respect network bandwidth
- Avoid denial of service
- Use appropriate timing and intensity
- Consider IDS/IPS detection

### Stealth Techniques
- Use slow scanning rates
- Randomize scan order
- Fragment packets
- Use proxies or VPNs
- Spoof source addresses (with caution)

## Defense Against Scanning

### Network Level
- Configure firewalls properly
- Implement IDS/IPS systems
- Use network segmentation
- Rate limiting and throttling

### System Level
- Close unnecessary ports
- Disable unused services
- Keep systems patched
- Use host-based firewalls
- Monitor system logs
