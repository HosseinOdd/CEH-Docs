title: Proxies Overview
description: An introduction to proxies and how they are used in networking and privacy

## What is a Proxy?

A proxy server is an intermediate system that sits between a client and a destination server.
Instead of connecting directly to a website or service, the client sends requests through the proxy, which then forwards them to the target.

This approach is commonly used in networking for privacy, access control, and traffic management.

## Why Proxies Are Used

Proxies are widely used for legitimate and practical reasons, including:

- Improving user privacy by masking direct connections
- Controlling outbound and inbound network traffic
- Distributing requests across multiple servers
- Bypassing regional or network-based restrictions
- Reducing load on destination servers
- Monitoring and filtering network usage

## How a Proxy Works

Client → Proxy Server → Destination Server

The destination server only sees the proxy server as the source of the request.

## Common Types of Proxies

### HTTP Proxies
Designed specifically for web traffic and commonly used in browsers.

### SOCKS Proxies
More flexible proxies that can support different types of network traffic.

### Transparent Proxies
Operate without explicit client configuration and are often used in managed networks.

### Anonymous Proxies
Reduce exposed client information and improve privacy.

### High Anonymity Proxies
Provide stronger privacy by hiding both client identity and proxy usage.

## Proxies vs VPNs

| Feature | Proxy | VPN |
|------|------|-----|
| Traffic scope | Application-based | System-wide |
| Encryption | Optional | Enabled by default |
| Speed | Usually faster | Slightly slower |

---

## Limitations

- Not all traffic may be routed automatically
- Some proxies may log activity
- Performance depends on proxy quality

---

## Summary

Proxies are a fundamental networking concept used to control and manage traffic between clients and servers.
