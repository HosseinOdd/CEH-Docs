## Core Concepts

### Information Security (InfoSec)
The practice of protecting information and information systems from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction.

### CIA Triad
The three fundamental principles of information security:
- **Confidentiality**: Ensuring data is accessible only to authorized entities
- **Integrity**: Maintaining accuracy and trustworthiness of data
- **Availability**: Ensuring reliable access to systems and data when needed

### Threat, Vulnerability, and Risk

**Threat**: Any potential event or actor that can cause harm to a system or data.

**Vulnerability**: A weakness in a system, application, or process that can be exploited.

**Risk**: The potential impact of a threat exploiting a vulnerability.
