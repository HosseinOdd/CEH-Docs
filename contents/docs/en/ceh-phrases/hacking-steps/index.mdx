## Overview

In Ethical Hacking and the CEH framework, hacking is a structured and methodical process used to identify and exploit security weaknesses — always with proper authorization. Understanding these steps helps security professionals analyze attacker behavior and improve defensive strategies.

## Hacking Methodology

### 1. Reconnaissance (Footprinting)
The initial phase where information about the target is gathered before any direct attack occurs.

This phase may include:
- Collecting IP addresses and domain information
- Identifying network ranges
- Gathering organizational and employee details

Reconnaissance can be:
- **Passive**: No direct interaction with the target
- **Active**: Direct interaction with target systems

---

### 2. Scanning
In this phase, the attacker actively scans the target to identify technical details and vulnerabilities.

Scanning activities include:
- Port scanning
- Service and version detection
- Operating system fingerprinting
- Vulnerability scanning

Common tools: Nmap, Nessus, OpenVAS

---

### 3. Gaining Access
This phase involves exploiting identified vulnerabilities to gain access to the target system.

Common techniques include:
- Exploiting software vulnerabilities
- Password attacks
- Abuse of misconfigurations
- Weak authentication exploitation

This step represents the actual system compromise.

---

### 4. Maintaining Access
After gaining access, the attacker attempts to maintain persistence within the system.

Common methods:
- Installing backdoors
- Creating hidden user accounts
- Using trojans or rootkits

This phase highlights the importance of monitoring and intrusion detection.

---

### 5. Covering Tracks (Clearing Tracks)
The final phase focuses on hiding evidence of the attack to avoid detection and forensic investigation.

Actions may include:
- Deleting or modifying log files
- Disabling security alerts
- Obfuscating malicious activities

## Importance in CEH

These five steps represent the classic hacking lifecycle taught in CEH and are essential for understanding how attacks are planned, executed, and concealed.
