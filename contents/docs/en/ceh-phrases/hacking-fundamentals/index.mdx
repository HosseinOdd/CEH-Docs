## Core Concepts

### Information Security (InfoSec)
Protecting information and information systems from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction.

### CIA Triad
The three pillars of information security:
- **Confidentiality**: Ensuring data is accessible only to authorized parties
- **Integrity**: Maintaining accuracy and completeness of data
- **Availability**: Ensuring authorized users have reliable access to information

### Types of Hackers

**White Hat Hackers**: Ethical hackers who use their skills to improve security with authorization.

**Black Hat Hackers**: Malicious hackers who break into systems for personal gain or harm.

**Grey Hat Hackers**: Hackers who operate between ethical and unethical boundaries.

**Script Kiddies**: Inexperienced hackers using pre-made tools without deep understanding.

**Hacktivists**: Hackers motivated by political or social causes.

## Security Concepts

### Authentication
Verifying the identity of a user or system before granting access.

### Authorization
Determining what resources an authenticated user can access.

### Encryption
Converting data into coded format to prevent unauthorized access.

### Firewall
Security system that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic.

### Intrusion Detection System (IDS)
Monitors network traffic for suspicious activity and alerts administrators.

### Intrusion Prevention System (IPS)
Actively blocks detected threats in addition to monitoring.

## Attack Methodology

1. **Reconnaissance**: Gathering information about the target
2. **Scanning**: Identifying vulnerabilities and entry points
3. **Gaining Access**: Exploiting vulnerabilities to enter the system
4. **Maintaining Access**: Establishing persistent presence
5. **Covering Tracks**: Removing evidence of the intrusion

## Common Vulnerabilities

- **Weak Passwords**: Easily guessable or default credentials
- **Unpatched Systems**: Missing security updates and patches
- **Misconfiguration**: Improperly configured security settings
- **Zero-Day Exploits**: Unknown vulnerabilities without available fixes
- **Human Error**: Mistakes made by users or administrators
