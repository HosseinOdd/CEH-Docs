# Installing Metasploitable


Metasploitable is an intentionally vulnerable virtual machine designed for practicing penetration testing and learning about vulnerabilities. It's meant to be run in an isolated VM environment.


> ⚠️ Warning: Metasploitable is purposely insecure. **Do not** expose it directly to production networks or the public Internet. Use an isolated network (Host-Only) or NAT for lab use.

## Files extracted after unzip

| File | Description |
|---|---|
| `metasploitable.vmdk` | Main virtual disk — **required** |
| `metasploitable.vmx` | VMware configuration (for reference) |
| `metasploitable.vmsd` | Snapshot metadata (optional) |
| `metasploitable.nvram` | NVRAM/BIOS state (usually not needed) |
| `metasploitable.vmxf` | Additional VMware metadata (non-essential) |


> Summary: For **VirtualBox** the key file is `metasploitable.vmdk`. The rest are VMware artifacts; you can recreate equivalent settings in VirtualBox.

## Installing Metasploitable on VirtualBox


### Method 1 — Use VMDK directly (simple)


1. Open VirtualBox.
2. Click **New**.
- Name: `Metasploitable`
- Type: `Linux`
- Version: choose `Other Linux (32-bit)` or the closest match.
3. RAM: around **512 MB** to **1 GB** (depends on the version).
4. When asked for a hard disk choose **Use an existing virtual hard disk file** and select `metasploitable.vmdk`.
5. Open VM Settings:
- **System → Motherboard**: ensure Hard Disk is in Boot Order.
- **System → Processor**: set at least 1 CPU.
- **Network**: prefer **NAT** or **Host-Only Adapter**. For safe isolated labs use Host-Only or Internal Network.
6. Start the VM. You should be able to log in (common default credentials for some builds are `msfadmin:msfadmin` — verify with your version).


### Method 2 — Convert VMDK to VDI (optional, recommended for better compatibility)


If you prefer VirtualBox native disk format:


Run in terminal / command prompt where VBoxManage is available:


```bash
VBoxManage clonehd metasploitable.vmdk metasploitable.vdi --format VDI
```


Then when creating the VM, choose the existing `metasploitable.vdi`.


### Recommended network settings for a lab


- **Host-Only**: isolates the VM so only host and VMs can communicate — safest for practice.
- **NAT + Port Forwarding**: use when you need host-to-VM access (e.g., SSH) while keeping VM non-public.
- **Avoid Bridged** on public or production networks.

## Practical & security tips


- Keep Metasploitable disconnected from the public Internet.
- Take snapshots before major changes so you can revert.
- Use Host-Only or Internal networks for multi-VM labs (Kali → target VM).
- Default credentials are often part of the lab exercises; change them only if you understand the implications.
