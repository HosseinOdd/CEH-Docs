# Installing OWASP BWA


OWASP Broken Web Applications (BWA) is a collection of vulnerable web applications compiled by the OWASP project for educational purposes and practicing web security. This virtual machine contains multiple web applications with various vulnerabilities.


> ⚠️ Warning: OWASP BWA is intentionally insecure. **Never** connect it to public networks or the Internet. Use only in isolated lab environments.

## About OWASP BWA


OWASP BWA includes numerous vulnerable applications such as:


- **WebGoat** - OWASP's learning environment
- **DVWA (Damn Vulnerable Web Application)** - Vulnerable PHP/MySQL web app
- **Mutillidae** - OWASP vulnerable web application
- **bWAPP** - A buggy web application
- **Hackxor** - Realistic game for practicing web hacking
- And many more...

## Downloading OWASP BWA


1. Visit the official OWASP page: [https://sourceforge.net/projects/owaspbwa/](https://sourceforge.net/projects/owaspbwa/)
2. Download the latest version (usually a ZIP file or VMDK/OVA file)
3. Extract the downloaded file


---


## Extracted Files


Depending on the version downloaded, you may have:


| File | Description |
|---|---|
| `OWASP-BWA.vmdk` | Main virtual disk — **required** |
| `OWASP-BWA.vmx` | VMware configuration file |
| `OWASP-BWA.ovf` | Open Virtualization Format (for import in VirtualBox) |
| `OWASP-BWA.ova` | Single OVA package (contains all necessary files) |

## Installing OWASP BWA on VirtualBox


### Method 1 — Import OVA File (Recommended)


If you have an `.ova` file:


1. Open VirtualBox
2. Go to **File → Import Appliance**
3. Select the `.ova` file and click **Next**
4. Review settings (you can adjust RAM and CPU)
5. Click **Import** and wait for the process to complete


### Method 2 — Use VMDK Directly


If you only have a `.vmdk` file:


1. Open VirtualBox
2. Click **New**
- Name: `OWASP-BWA`
- Type: `Linux`
- Version: `Ubuntu (32-bit)` or `Ubuntu (64-bit)` depending on version
3. RAM: at least **1 GB** (recommended **2 GB**)
4. When selecting hard disk: choose **Use an existing virtual hard disk file** and select `OWASP-BWA.vmdk`
5. Create the VM and open Settings:
- **System → Motherboard**: verify Boot Order
- **System → Processor**: at least 1-2 CPUs
- **Network**: use **Host-Only Adapter** or **NAT**


### Method 3 — Convert OVF to VirtualBox


If you have an `.ovf` file:


1. Go to **File → Import Appliance** in VirtualBox
2. Select the `.ovf` file
3. Review and confirm settings

## Network Configuration


For security, always use one of these:


- **Host-Only Network**: for access only from host system (most secure)
- **NAT Network**: if you need internet access for updates (use cautiously)
- **Internal Network**: for connecting with other VMs in the lab


**Never** use Bridged Network!


---


## Initial Setup


1. Start the VM
2. Wait for the system to boot
3. Default credentials (typically):
   - Username: `root`
   - Password: `owaspbwa`


4. Find the machine's IP address:
```bash
ifconfig
# or
ip addr show
```


5. From your host browser, navigate to the IP address:
```
http://[IP_ADDRESS]
```


6. The OWASP BWA main page will display with a list of all vulnerable applications


---


## Available Applications and Access


After accessing the main page (`http://[IP]`), you can select different applications:


- **WebGoat**: for learning OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities
- **DVWA**: for practicing various web penetration testing techniques
- **Mutillidae**: includes SQL Injection, XSS, CSRF, etc.
- **bWAPP**: over 100 web vulnerabilities


Each application has its own link and documentation.


---


## Security and Practical Tips


- **Snapshot**: take a snapshot before starting practice so you can restore to initial state
- **Network Isolation**: always ensure the VM is on an isolated network
- **Updates**: avoid updating the VM's OS as it may patch vulnerabilities
- **Documentation**: each application has its own documentation that you should read
- **Practice Ethically**: only practice on these VMs, not on real systems


---


## Troubleshooting Common Issues


### Cannot Access Web Server

- Verify the VM is running
- Ensure Apache service is running:
```bash
sudo service apache2 status
```


### Network Issues

- Check Network Adapter settings in VirtualBox
- Ensure Host-Only Adapter is enabled
- Re-check IP with `ifconfig`


### Login Issues

- Default credentials: `root` / `owaspbwa`
- If changed, refer to your version's documentation
