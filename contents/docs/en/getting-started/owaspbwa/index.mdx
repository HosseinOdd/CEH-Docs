# Installing OWASP BWA


OWASP Broken Web Applications (BWA) is a collection of vulnerable web applications designed by the OWASP project for education and practicing web security. This virtual machine includes multiple web applications with various vulnerabilities.


> ⚠️ Warning: OWASP BWA intentionally contains security vulnerabilities. **Never** connect it to public networks or the Internet. Use only in isolated lab environments.

## About OWASP BWA


OWASP BWA includes numerous vulnerable applications such as:


- **WebGoat** - OWASP learning environment
- **DVWA (Damn Vulnerable Web Application)** - Vulnerable PHP/MySQL web application
- **Mutillidae** - OWASP vulnerable web application
- **bWAPP** - Buggy vulnerable web application
- **Hackxor** - Realistic game for practicing web hacking
- And many more...

## Extracted Files After Unzip

| File | Description |
|---|---|
| `OWASP_Broken_Web_Apps.vmdk` | Main virtual disk — **required** |
| `OWASP_Broken_Web_Apps.vmx` | VMware configuration (for reference) |
| `OWASP_Broken_Web_Apps.vmsd` | Snapshot metadata (optional) |
| `OWASP_Broken_Web_Apps.nvram` | NVRAM/BIOS state (usually not needed) |
| `OWASP_Broken_Web_Apps.vmxf` | Additional VMware metadata (unnecessary) |

> Summary: Only the `OWASP_Broken_Web_Apps.vmdk` file is sufficient to run the machine in VirtualBox. Other files are used for VMware.

## Installing OWASP BWA on VirtualBox


### Method 1 — Import OVA File (Recommended)


If you have an `.ova` file:


1. Open VirtualBox
2. From the menu, select **File → Import Appliance**
3. Select the `.ova` file and click **Next**
4. Review the settings (you can adjust RAM and CPU)
5. Click **Import** and wait for the import to complete


### Method 2 — Use VMDK Directly


If you only have a `.vmdk` file:


1. Open VirtualBox
2. Click **New**
- Name: `OWASP-BWA`
- Type: `Linux`
- Version: `Ubuntu (32-bit)` or `Ubuntu (64-bit)` depending on version
3. RAM: at least **1 GB** (recommended **2 GB**)
4. When selecting hard disk: choose **Use an existing virtual hard disk file** and select the `OWASP-BWA.vmdk` file
5. Create the VM and open Settings:
- **System → Motherboard**: verify Boot Order
- **System → Processor**: at least 1-2 CPUs
- **Network**: use **Host-Only Adapter** or **NAT**


### Method 3 — Convert OVF to VirtualBox


If you have an `.ovf` file:


1. From the menu **File → Import Appliance** in VirtualBox
2. Select the `.ovf` file
3. Review and confirm the settings

## Network Configuration


For security, always use one of these:


- **Host-Only Network**: for access only from the host system (most secure)
- **NAT Network**: if you need internet access for updates (use cautiously)
- **Internal Network**: for connecting with other VMs in the lab


**Never** use Bridged Network!


---


## Initial Setup


1. Start the VM
2. Wait for the system to boot
3. Default login credentials (typically):
   - Username: `root`
   - Password: `owaspbwa`


4. Find the machine's IP address:
```bash
ifconfig
# or
ip addr show
```


5. From your host system browser, navigate to the IP address:
```
http://[IP_ADDRESS]
```


6. The OWASP BWA main page will display with a list of all vulnerable applications

## Security and Practical Tips


- **Snapshot**: Take a snapshot before starting practice so you can restore the system to its initial state
- **Network Isolation**: Always ensure the VM is on an isolated network
- **Updates**: Avoid updating the VM's operating system as it may patch vulnerabilities
- **Documentation**: Each application has its own documentation that you should read
- **Practice Ethically**: Only practice on these VMs, not on real systems
